                    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,

                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English.

                  To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                  first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                  <code
                    >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                  </code>
            
                  Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                  browser!

                <article>
                  <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                          null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                          is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                          other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                          Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                          unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
            
                    <li>and Object</li>
                  </ul>
                  Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                  to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                  are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                  objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                  your application can perform.
